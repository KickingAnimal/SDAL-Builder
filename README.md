**SDAL Builder** is an advanced, modular Python toolchain for building [SDAL Parcel Storage Format (PSF) v1.7](#sdal-parcel-storage-format-psf-v17) map archives from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data extracts.  
It is designed for researchers, navigation developers, and simulation projects needing highly compressed, spatially indexed, verifiable map data — directly from OSM `.pbf` files.

## Features

- **End-to-end OSM → SDAL pipeline:** Automates download, parsing, indexing, encoding, and ISO packaging.
- **Structural compliance:** Generates structurally complete 512-byte headers (`GlbMediaHeader_t`, `RgnHdr_t`) with correctly populated PID size tables (`ucaParcelSizes`).
- **Configurable format mode:**
  - **OEM mode** (default) — maintains compatibility with custom table files like `REGIONS.SDL`.
  - **SDAL mode** — strict structural compliance, including full `RgnHdr_t` in regional files.
- **Streaming OSM processing:** Handles very large `.osm.pbf` files efficiently using Osmium-based streaming, with live progress reporting and minimal RAM usage.
- **Parcels & indexes:** Packs cartographic and navigational data into SDAL parcel families; builds spatial (KD-tree) and OSM Way ID (B+-tree) indexes.
- **Compression support:** Parcels are encoded using the `NO_COMPRESSION` (`0x01`) flag to ensure structural integrity and compatibility. Implementation of Huffman/SZIP algorithms is currently stubbed or removed.
- **Density overlays:** Optional per-region density data for visualization or QA.
- **Modular codebase:** Clear separation of ETL, encoding, spatial indexing, and ISO writing.
- **CLI-driven with robust logging:** For reproducible, scriptable builds.
- **Format compliance:** Output follows SDAL PSF v1.7 specification, especially in **SDAL mode**.

## Recent Enhancements

1. **Streamlined Build Process (“Baking” Constants)**  
   The build now no longer depends on a physical `INIT.SDL` being present in the `oem_sdl` folder for every run.  
   - A new helper tool, `create_constants.py`, is executed once during the initial setup. It parses an original OEM `INIT.SDL`, extracts static binary headers and translation dictionaries, and “bakes” them into a Python module: `src/sdal_builder/init_constants.py`.  
   - The main builder (`main.py`) imports these constants directly, making the build process self-contained, deterministic, and less error-prone.

2. **OEM-Compliant File Structure**  
   To better match the strict expectations of older SDAL head units, several output files have been refined:  
   - **Split Density (Traffic) Data:** Density layers now follow the OEM pattern and are written as two files per region:  
     - `DENSxx0.SDL` — metadata, headers, and table structures.  
     - `DENSxx1.SDL` — raw tile payloads.  
   - **Corrected `KDTREE.SDL` Header:** The `KDTREE.SDL` file now starts with a properly populated `IDxPclHdr_t` header before the KD-tree payload. This allows the navigation system to correctly detect global and regional bounding boxes.

3. **Deep Validation Tool (`validate_sdal_iso.py`)**  
   The ISO validator has been completely rewritten and now performs structural integrity checks instead of just verifying file presence:  
   - **Parcel Chain Check:** Walks SDAL map files byte-by-byte to verify parcel chains (`Header → Length → Padding → Next Header`).  
   - **OEM Signatures:** Looks for specific ASCII signatures and binary markers in `INIT.SDL` that OEM discs are known to contain.  
   - **Topology Linkage:** Verifies that `DB_ID` references in the global index (`CARTOTOP.SDL`) match the IDs embedded inside regional map files.  
   - **Index Tree Structure:** Performs basic shape checks on B-trees and K-trees to reduce the risk of runtime search failures in the head unit.

4. **Encoding & Compatibility**  
   To maximize compatibility with older firmware and simplify debugging:  
   - All currently implemented text/data parcels (e.g., `POINAMES`, `NAV`) are written using the `NO_COMPRESSION` mode.  
   - Huffman and SZIP compression paths are intentionally disabled or bypassed. Headers remain SDAL-compliant, so compression can be re-enabled in a future version without breaking the format.

## Data Flow (How It Works)

High-level walkthrough of what happens when you build an SDAL ISO:

| Step | What Happens                                                                                          | Main Modules                           |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | OSM `.pbf` for the specified region is fetched from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/).      | `sdal_build.py`, `main.py`             |

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python **3.9+**
- Basic build tools (for dependencies like `numpy`, `shapely`, `pyrosm`, `pyosmium`, etc.)

### Install Steps

```bash
# Clone and enter the project directory
git clone https://github.com/yourname/sdal_builder.git
cd sdal_builder

# Set up a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The Osmium library and Python bindings (`pyosmium`) are required for streaming mode.  
You may need to install system packages:

- **Ubuntu / Debian**

  ```bash
  sudo apt install libosmium2-dev
  ```

- **macOS (Homebrew)**

  ```bash
  brew install osmium-tool
  ```

- **Windows**

  See the `pyosmium` documentation for up-to-date installation instructions.

## Usage

### 1. Building an SDAL ISO

The helper script `build.sh` provides a simple interface and accepts the format mode flag.

#### Using the helper script

```bash
./build.sh <region> [region2 ...] [output.iso] [--format-mode {OEM|SDAL}]
```

**Example (OEM Mode – default):**  
Uses custom OEM headers for control files (`REGION.SDL`, `MTOC.SDL`) and places map parcels directly at the start of map files (`XXX1.SDL`).

```bash
./build.sh europe/cyprus europe/spain my_maps.iso
```

**Example (SDAL Mode – strict structural compliance):**  
Enforces native SDAL headers for regional map files (`XXX1.SDL`), which will start with a 512-byte Region Header (`RgnHdr_t`) followed by alignment to the unit size.

```bash
./build.sh europe/germany --format-mode SDAL --out germany_sdal.iso
```

#### Direct Python usage (advanced / CI)

```bash
python sdal_build.py <region> [--out <output.iso>] [--format-mode {OEM|SDAL}]
```

Region names use Geofabrik-style naming, for example:

- `europe/cyprus`
- `europe/germany`
- `north-america/us/california`

### 2. Validating an SDAL ISO

After building, you can validate ISO file integrity:

```bash
python validate_sdal_iso.py my_maps.iso
```

This performs structural checks based on the SDAL PSF v1.7 layout.

---

## Choosing the OSM Processing Engine

### Default Behavior

The builder uses **Pyrosm** for small and medium regions, and automatically switches to **Osmium streaming** for large `.osm.pbf` files to reduce memory usage.

### Manual Selection

If your CLI exposes engine selection flags, you can override the default:

- To force **Osmium streaming** (recommended for files over ~2 GB):

  ```bash
  python sdal_build.py <region> --engine osmium
  ```

- To force **Pyrosm**:

  ```bash
  python sdal_build.py <region> --engine pyrosm
  ```

If these flags are not available in your build of the project, engine selection is automatic based on file size.

## Burning SDAL DVDs (Windows / ImgBurn)

Most Saab / Mazda SDAL navigation units are extremely picky about media and burn settings.  
Use good discs, correct booktype, and slow speed – otherwise the car will simply say **“NO DISC”**.

Below is the recommended procedure for burning SDAL images (e.g. `WE_06Q4.iso`) using **ImgBurn** on Windows.

### 1. Requirements

- **ImgBurn** 2.5.x or later
- Blank dual-layer DVD:
  - Prefer **Verbatim DVD+R DL**  
    (DVD-R DL can work, but booktype settings don’t apply there)
- A burner that supports changing **Book Type** (bitsetting) for DVD+R DL

### 2. Start ImgBurn and Load the Image

1. Launch ImgBurn.
2. Choose **“Write image file to disc”**.
3. Insert a blank DL disc.
4. Load the correct image:
   - If you have e.g. `WE_06Q4.MDS`, select the **`.MDS`** file, not the `.ISO`.  
     The `.MDS` holds proper layer-break information and is recommended in SDAL guides (especially for Mazda / Saab SDAL images).
   - If there is no `.MDS`, select the `.ISO` directly (e.g. `WE_06Q4.iso`).

### 3. Set BookType to DVD-ROM (for DVD+R DL)

This is critical for many SDAL nav drives – without **DVD-ROM** booktype they often won’t recognise the disc.

1. In ImgBurn, click the small **“book”** icon (Change Book Type) in the lower-right corner.
2. In the dialog:
   - Select your drive’s manufacturer.
   - **Change For** → `DVD+R DL Media`.
   - **New Setting** → `DVD-ROM`.
3. Click **Change**, confirm success, then **OK**.

If you are using **DVD-R DL**, booktype is fixed and this step doesn’t apply – but DVD+R DL with DVD-ROM booktype is strongly preferred.

### 4. Set Write Speed

SDAL nav units (Saab, Mazda, etc.) are known to dislike fast burns.

- **Recommended Write Speed:** `2x` or `2.4x`
  - Mazda SDAL Western Europe instructions explicitly say max `2x`.
  - Saab/Mazda SDAL users report best results with the lowest speed on Verbatim DL media.

In ImgBurn:

1. In the main window, set **Write Speed** to `2x` (or `2.4x` if `2x` isn’t available).
2. If the drive internally bumps it slightly, that’s usually OK.

### 5. Write Mode & Options

Make sure you’re burning a proper single-session disc, not using packet-writing.

- **Write mode:** Disc-At-Once (**DAO**)  
  SDAL guides explicitly state that incremental / packet writing makes discs unreadable in the car.
- **Finalize Disc:** Enabled (close track / session).  
  ImgBurn does this by default – don’t disable it.
- Leave other advanced ImgBurn settings at defaults unless you know exactly why you’re changing them.

### 6. Burn the Disc

1. Click the big **burn** button.
2. Let the burn finish without heavily using the PC (avoid causing buffer underruns).

Optionally allow ImgBurn to **Verify** after writing:  
this adds time but catches bad burns and marginal media.

### 7. Test in the Car

1. Start the car and let voltage stabilise (engine running is best).
2. Insert the disc into the nav drive.
3. Wait:
   - First boot after an update can take longer.
   - Some SDAL discs may perform a small firmware update during first use; **do not interrupt power**.

If the unit doesn’t see the disc at all (immediate “NO DISC” or ejection):

- Re-check:
  - Disc type (DVD+R DL, good brand).
  - Booktype = DVD-ROM (for +R DL).
  - Burn speed (`2x` / `2.4x`).
  - DAO + finalized.
- Try a different blank disc (same good brand), and/or a different burner.
- Confirm the drive still reads a known-good original nav disc – if not, the laser may be weak or dirty.

---

## Cleaning Up

To remove temporary files, caches, and build artifacts:

```bash
./build.sh --clean
```

This will typically:

- Remove Python bytecode caches.
- Optionally remove `.venv` (virtual environment), depending on your script implementation.
- Remove build directories and `.iso` files.

(Check the `build.sh` script to see exactly what it deletes in your version.)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which regions are available?**  

**A:** Any region or subregion supported by Geofabrik can be used.  
Examples: `europe/cyprus`, `europe/germany`.  
(See the Geofabrik download site for a full list.)

---

**Q: Does this generate DENSO files?**  

**A:** No. This project outputs **SDAL-compliant ISO archives only**.  
If DENSO compatibility is added later, it will be documented here.

---

**Q: Can I use my own OSM `.pbf` file?**  

**A:** Yes. Place your `.osm.pbf` file in `build/tmp` (or your configured working directory) and adjust the CLI arguments accordingly.

---

**Q: Does this include turn-by-turn routing?**  

**A:** No. While the navigational topology is included for routing engines, actual routing or navigation logic is **not** implemented in this project.

---

**Q: My machine runs out of memory on large OSM files!**  

**A:** Use the **Osmium streaming mode** for processing. It minimizes memory usage and provides progress updates.  
See [Choosing the OSM Processing Engine](#choosing-the-osm-processing-engine).

## SDAL Parcel Storage Format (PSF) v1.7

This project builds archives according to the **SDAL PSF v1.7** specification (to the extent currently implemented):

- **Full Structural Compliance (goal):**
  - Support generating files with complete, logically populated 512-byte headers:
    - `GlbMediaHeader_t` in `INIT.SDL`
    - `RgnHdr_t` in regional files
  - Correct index parcel layouts (e.g., global KD-tree parcels with properly structured `IDxPclHdr_t`).

- **Header Integrity:**
  - PID size tables (`ucaParcelSizes`) in `GlbMediaHeader_t` are populated with correct size indices (default `0` where appropriate).

- **Compression Note:**
  - Parcels are encoded using the `NO_COMPRESSION` flag to ensure maximum compatibility and structural integrity.
  - Integration of compression algorithms (Huffman, SZIP) is currently a placeholder or removed.

- **Cartographic and Navigable Parcels:**
  - Store road geometry, topology, and names in binary parcel families for efficient loading.

- **Spatial Indexing:**
  - Two-level KD-tree enables fast spatial lookups for geometry.

- **OSM Way Indexing:**
  - Sparse B+-tree provides byte-level addressability of any original OSM way.

- **Per-Parcel Integrity:**
  - Each parcel is verified with a CRC32 checksum.

- **ISO Image Packaging:**
  - All parcels, indexes, and metadata are written to a single SDAL ISO image.

Refer to the official SDAL PSF v1.7 documentation for exact binary layouts and field semantics.
